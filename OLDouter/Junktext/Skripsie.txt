POA

stereoscopic cameras to recognize an object and use depth perception to calculate distance (and maybe speed)


1. choose if camereas are downwards facing or angled. pixel shift or pixel and perspective shift. the latter more accurate but more complex and computationally intensive. 

2. have a camera that can transmit realtime wired. 

3. strong processor like pi

4. train an ML model to track an object. decide what object. needs to have distinct points as ground is ground. not sure if libraries with mountains or whatever. might need to use AI to decide what is the most informative to track. 

5. optimize for realtime

6. choose accuracy of camere and tilt depending on altitude. 

7. test with camera. different objects. reel up height adjustment.

8. can implement autotilt for different distance measurements.
