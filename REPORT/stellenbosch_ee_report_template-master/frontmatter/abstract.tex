Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for precise navigation, but vulnerabilities such as jamming and spoofing can jeopardize mission success. This project developed an image-based redundancy navigation system to ensure reliable UAV navigation following GNSS signal loss. The system optimizes the positional inference pipeline by integrating advanced feature extraction, matching, and planar transformation techniques, achieving radial localization errors below 2\% of the UAV's displacement from a reference image. Designed for real-time operation, the system provides estimated position and heading within two seconds, enabling pilots to maintain effective control. Comprehensive testing across diverse environments demonstrated the system's high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability without the need for environment-specific tuning. It remained effective in challenging operational conditions including variations in lighting, image information overlap, camera tilt, and resolution. This image-based redundancy navigation system offers a practical and dependable redundancy solution for enhancing UAV operational safety and supporting national security.
