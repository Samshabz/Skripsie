\chapter{Feature Extractors}


2. What information did u draw from or acquire to solve problem. What did I learn not from EE engineering. Additional to undergrad. 

e.g. water quality: UV spectrum, optical sensing, color spectrum moving signals. Capture additional technologies and information to do design. Anything beyond scope of EE, lecturer might not know. I needed to know this before addressing problem. 

eg i have these 3 options at my disposal or many. 

\section{Intropara}

This chapter focuses on the additional prerequisite knowledge required to solve the problem above what the reader is expected to know. The image-based navigation system involves many functional parts which need to be understood and integrated to solve the problem. This includes the technique of feature extraction, feature matching, and homographic estimation based on the change in rotation and translation of the landscape. 

\subsection*{Feature Extractors}
In this report, we conduct an in-depth evaluation of various feature extractors to determine the most suitable one for real-time, robust and accurate UAV-based navigation.
