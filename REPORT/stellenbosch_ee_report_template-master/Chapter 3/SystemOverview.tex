Pseudocode:

stage 1: 
while gps not lost and not bool infer camera parameters and factors:
import image with stored telemetry data (GPS and heading)
extract features of image
Normalize image xy to global heading space


stage 2:
while gps not lost and BOOL_infer_factors:
- Same as stage 1
INFER GPS-TO-PIXEL-RATIO:
    Global Matching (find a reference image):
        Reduce reference image search space by GPS proximity  
        Reduce to single reference image with global matching technique
    Local Matching (infer transformations between):
        Accurate relative angle between images with local matching technique
        Accurate translation estimation between images with local matching technique

Estimate factor of least error that aligns estimated pixel translation to GPS metre translation across samples(XXX - check least square 4 etc)

stage 3:
while GPS lost:
extract features of image
Global Matching (find a reference image):
    Reduce reference image search space by GPS proximity  
    Reduce to single reference image with global matching technique
Local Matching (infer transformations between):
    Accurate relative angle between images with local matching technique
    Normalize image xy to global heading space with acquired angle. 
    Accurate translation estimation between images with local matching technique
    Infer GPS with inferred pixel ratio and global-space translation
