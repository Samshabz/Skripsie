\section*{Concept}

The flow of the camera system shall be as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The controller shall receive footage in real-time from the UAV and sync it with known telemetry data such as GPS coordinates, altitude, heading and speed.
    \item The controller shall then process the video footage and telemetry data to extract and store the relevant features
    \item When the GPS signal is lost, the UAV will turn around
    \item The controller shall extract and match the features of the current image with that of the previous images
    \item It will find the most correlated images and use that image to determine the change in feature locations to infer the UAV's position
\end{enumerate}
