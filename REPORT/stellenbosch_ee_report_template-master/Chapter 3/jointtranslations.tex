Estimating the translation between two images is crucial. In this task it is the direct estimation technique to infer our GPS. Note, initially we must transform all our images into a global space to do translation estimation. That is because the x and y need to be aligned to N and E respectively. We cannot find translations between two images that have not been aligned with both themselves and the global space by normalizing the estimated translation post-estimation. This is because

Note, phase correlation is highly accurate for most cases. However, it has erratic performance for some cases. Phase correlation, unlike the other local matching methods which work on matched points, is a global matching method which works on the entire image. Subsequently, it has extreme sensitivity to rotational differences in images. In an ideal scenario, it proves extremely accurate, however, in the real world, heading estimations can be affected by a variety of external factors, and as such, it is not suitable due to lack of robustness.
Leverage this as proof of lack of applicability for global matching techniques on local scale. 
Note the issue was resolved with gaussian blur completely (3x3)
further shown when using different keypoints: if low, slight decrease in rot acc, completely messes it up

cross check for rotations is way too slow - like 10x or more
    
I did not have exact rotations - limited accuracy. I suppose it shows robustness of the method.

with method 1, phase correlation: does not work on this dataset. dont mention this - but it works with larger rotations, which could be some adverse effect of adding black parts to the image. It might be aligning borders, since scale is equivalent- I think actually note that. it does work with 0.00252: Mean normalized GPS error: [52.81922868]

note: inference heading was used to show its practicality in real life accross different datasets. However, its lack of accuracy still introduces a systematic error. 

note: average distance 500-1500m radial between inference and reference image - in reality could be much lower

variance is times a million. 
Rigid stability has the closest mean, but a high variance. Affine is extremely stable, with sufficient degrees of freedom, but is more inaccurate. Phase correlation has a poor mean and variance. However, if the rotations are worked out precisely, it is the most accurate. 
These results affirm that the data is sufficiently clean after extraction and matching, because of the method strength, and methods that add more nuanced filtration and transformations tend to only add inaccuracy. With that being said, if data is much less clean, for instance if the weather or lighting is bad, rigid or affine should be considered. If the camera is unstable and altitude varies, homography should be considered. If the altitude alone is unstable, affine.

Translation methods: Moments, cross-correlation, gradient methods - none worked well.

Phase correlate method improvement techniques: Gauss blur, equalize, windowing, LPF \& HPF - however, none of these methods significantly improved its robustness to rotational inaccuracies.
