Estimating the translation between two images is crucial. In this task it is the direct estimation technique to infer our GPS. Note, initially we must transform all our images into a global space to do translation estimation. That is because the x and y need to be aligned to N and E respectively. We cannot find translations between two images that have not been aligned with both themselves and the global space by normalizing the estimated translation post-estimation. This is because

Note, phase correlation is highly accurate for most cases. However, it has erratic performance for some cases. Phase correlation, unlike the other local matching methods which work on matched points, is a global matching method which works on the entire image. Subsequently, it has extreme sensitivity to rotational differences in images. In an ideal scenario, it proves extremely accurate, however, in the real world, heading estimations can be affected by a variety of external factors, and as such, it is not suitable due to lack of robustness.
Leverage this as proof of lack of applicability for global matching techniques on local scale. 
Note the issue was resolved with gaussian blur completely (3x3)
further shown when using different keypoints: if low, slight decrease in rot acc, completely messes it up

cross check for rotations is way too slow - like 10x or more
    
I did not have exact rotations - limited accuracy. I suppose it shows robustness of the method.
