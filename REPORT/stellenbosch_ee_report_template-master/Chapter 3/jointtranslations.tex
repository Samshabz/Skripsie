Estimating the translation between two images is crucial. In this task it is the direct estimation technique to infer our GPS. Note, initially we must transform all our images into a global space to do translation estimation. That is because the x and y need to be aligned to N and E respectively. We cannot find translations between two images that have not been aligned with both themselves and the global space by normalizing the estimated translation post-estimation. This is because
