Homography: THIS IS a form of planar transformations. This is often used in this paper to generally describe planar transformations in the context of image processing such as affine etc.

planar transforms: Describes the general transformation of a plane in a 2D space. This is used in this paper to describe the transformation of a plane in the context of image processing.

feature detectors (or extractors): Refer to the extraction process involves in identifying features in an image. 

Features: These refer to the unique keypoints in an image and their associated descriptors

keypoints: These are the points in an image that are used to identify features in an image. They are areas of strong contrast in an image.

Descriptors: These are the numerical values that are used to describe the keypoints in an image. They contain compact information about the areas around the keypoints.

Local Matching: This is the process of matching keypoints in two images. This is done by comparing the descriptors of the keypoints in the two images.

Homography Estimation: This is the process of estimating the homography matrix that describes the transformation between two images.

Global Matching: This is the process of finding the similarity, and potentially the pose between images, using the entire image as context.
