\section{Background}
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become critical in modern military operations, providing capabilities in surveillance, reconnaissance, and intelligence gathering. In South Africa, UAVs are increasingly used to monitor borders and support military missions by enabling persistent aerial observation \cite{MARTIN}. Their ability to operate in dangerous or inaccessible areas makes them invaluable for various operations.

However, UAVs heavily rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, which poses a significant vulnerability. GPS signals are easily disrupted by jamming, spoofing, or interference in hostile environments, leading to navigation failure. Adversaries increasingly exploit these vulnerabilities, resulting in UAVs becoming disoriented or lost, jeopardizing both the mission and the UAV. 

The increasing prevalence of GPS disruptions highlights a critical need for alternative navigation solutions that can operate independently of external signals like GPS. These systems must be robust, accurate, and adaptable to a wide range of environments. Some alternatives include inertial navigation systems, radio frequency-based localization, and quantum positioning systems. However, these suffer from high costs, limited accuracy, susceptibility to detection, Earth curvature issues, or drift, making them impractical for widespread UAV deployment. One promising approach that does not fall prey to these issues is image-based navigation, where UAVs use onboard cameras to capture and match images with previously stored reference images to estimate their position. This method allows for autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments without requiring continuous GPS access.

However, image-based systems face uncertainty regarding their ability to offer real-time operation, achieve accurate results, and handle various environments. This project aims to test the viability of such a system, addressing the need for reliable UAV navigation without GPS dependency.

While conditions such as poor lighting and dynamic environments can pose practical challenges, advancements in technology and image processing algorithms have significantly improved the robustness of computer vision tasks to these challenges.

By leveraging these advancements, this project will develop and evaluate a system that employs the latest image processing techniques to deliver accurate and real-time localization for UAVs in GPS-denied environments. The solution will be rigorously tested against stringent performance metrics to assess its practicality and reliability in real-world scenarios.





\section{Problem Statement}
GPS-based UAV navigation is increasingly vulnerable to jamming and spoofing, risking loss of control. Current alternatives are either too expensive or unreliable, creating a need for a more robust, GPS-independent solution.

\section{Aims and Objectives}
\subsection{Aim}
The primary aim of this project is to develop an accurate and generalizable image-based GPS localization system to facilitate UAV navigation in GPS-denied environments.

\subsection{Objectives}
To achieve the stated aim, the following objectives have been established:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Optimize the Localization Pipeline:} Identify and implement the most effective pipeline, including parameter selection and methodological approaches, to achieve the highest possible localization accuracy while maintaining real-time performance and generalizability. This includes the selection, integration and optimization of feature extraction, matching, and planar transformation estimation techniques.
    
    \item \textbf{Accurate Localization Estimation:} Estimate the GPS location, using only prior telemetry data and image features, with a radial error below 10\% of the UAV's radial displacement from the reference image. This accuracy is sufficient for manual control of the UAV in GPS-denied environments, given that the system provides continuous correction.

    \item \textbf{Real-Time Operation:} Ensure the localization system operates in real-time, with a response time of less than 2 seconds following GPS signal loss. This is sufficient as the relative motion of the UAV to the ground is sufficiently slow that a 2-second delay will not significantly affect the pilots ability to navigate.
    
    \item \textbf{Environmental Generalizability:} Validate that the system maintains its performance metrics across diverse environments without the need for environment-specific parameter tuning.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary of Work}
This project successfully developed and implemented an image-based GPS localization system for UAV navigation in GPS-denied environments. The system met the outlined objectives, demonstrating high accuracy, real-time performance, and generalizability across multiple environments. Through comprehensive research and implementation of feature extraction, matching, and homographic techniques, the system effectively estimated the UAV's location with minimal error. The system was tested and deemed to be practically robust under low-light and limited overlap conditions, with the ability to handle various environments. The outcomes indicate significant potential for enhancing UAV navigation reliability in both military and civilian applications.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}
The scope of this project is defined to ensure feasibility and manageability within the allocated timeframe. The limitations are considered reasonable in practical scenarios or can be addressed in future, more detailed studies. These constraints do not hinder the ability to assess the solution's viability. The following assumptions and restrictions outline the project's boundaries:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Camera Orientation:} The UAV's downward-facing camera is assumed to remain perfectly aligned downward throughout all operations.
    
    \item \textbf{Image Quality:} It is assumed that the captured images are of sufficient resolution and free from significant distortions such as warping, blurring, or obstruction by clouds.
    
    \item \textbf{Operational Environment:} The UAV is expected to operate over predominantly static land surfaces with minimal dynamic objects, ensuring a stable environment for image-based localization.
    
    \item \textbf{Altitude Consistency:} The UAV maintains a constant altitude, negating the need for scale estimation in localization calculations.
    
    \item \textbf{Path Loss:} The UAV uses complementary, odometry-based systems to find its path back in the event of GPS signal loss, ensuring continuous operation.
    
    \item \textbf{Image Overlap:} Images used for localization have an overlap exceeding 60\%, ensuring sufficient reference information.
    
    \item \textbf{Method Choice:} The selected methods are based on comprehensive research and empirical testing, with the understanding that not all potential methods could be included within the scope of this study.
    
    \item \textbf{Ground Planarity:} The terrain is assumed to be significantly planar, minimizing perspective distortions that could affect localization accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{UAV Stability:} The UAV and its camera system remain level with the ground, eliminating pitch and roll variations.
    
    \item \textbf{Training Requirements:} The localization methods employed do not require pre-training or live training, ensuring operational simplicity and efficiency.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Provisioning:} The project used data from Google Earth due to delays in receiving the agreed-upon prerequisite data, with a minor impact on accuracy acknowledged due to the use of estimated headings.
    
    \item \textbf{System Output:} The system provides an estimated GPS location and heading, intended for manual UAV control by pilots rather than automated control systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} The system is optimized for real-time performance and generalizability. However, the focus is on testing the viability of the system rather than achieving the absolute best performance.
    
\end{itemize}

While these scope limitations streamline the project, they do not preclude the potential for future enhancements, such as incorporating scale estimation techniques or expanding the system's robustness to dynamic environmental conditions.
