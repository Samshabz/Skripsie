\label{chap:introduction}


CH1
 Background (1/2 to 1 page) - give context
- background is not what is the problem, but what is the context of the problem. Why does it matter. How many people suffer from lack of clean water for eg or die from car accidents. 

- problem statement (1 paragraph). Most important of entire report. Exactly what you have done. Nothing more or less. sentence or two. 
- objectives "fine-grain" SMART, numbers. If i meet these objectives, i have solved the problem statement in part. 1-5 objectives or sub-objectives or even requirements. Measured against objectives - metrics. 
Summary of work (not contribution for skripsie). what you have achieved. meeting objectives. 
- Scope: What will be done and not be done. Mainly what will not be done. Did not take into account organic material or eg did not consider mobility. Did think about other things - still important (e.g. future work). write it in such a way that it is positive  / what u did do. did not consider cost size market manufacturability etc. 
- Structure of Report (Not exactly the same as the Table of Contents): Roadmap, in chapter 2 I did the following etc

ECSA chapter 1: I took a vaguely defined problem (prob statement), understood what i must do to solve (objectives), and then solved it (summary of work).
Then, 




\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Background:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To maintain state safety, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used in military missions for surveillance, reconnaissance, and intelligence gathering. However, they rely on GPS for navigation, which can be jammed, spoofed, or otherwise lost in adversarial environments. This severely limits the scope of where these missions can be conducted, as well as the safety of the UAVs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem Statement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traditional GPS-based navigation systems are being increasingly jammed or spoofed, leading to an inability to localize and return to base. Additionally, other known solutions are prone to drift or are extremely expensive. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Motivation:!!!}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is a need for a navigation redundancy system that avoids detection in GPS-denied environments. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Aims and Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Aim:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop an accurate and generalizable image-based GPS localization system for UAV navigation in GPS-denied environments. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objectives:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find the most optimal pipeline to solve the given problem. That is, determine the most optimal parameter and method set that subtends the most accurate solution while maintaining real-time and generalizable operation.
        \item Determine the GPS of the UAV, using only prior telemetry and image features. The radial error must be below 10\% of the given movement, or 50m, whichever is higher. xxx, thi is if there is minimal movement
        \item Ensure the system can operate in real-time. The response time, post-GPS loss, must be below 2s. 
        \item Ascertain whether the system is generalizable to different environments. Specifically, the method should meet the above requirements under the condition that static or dynamically-tuned parameters are not tuned, directly or indirectly, for different environments.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assumptions and Restrictions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The downwards facing camera shall be aimed perfectly downwards for all time
        \item The datasets are at a reasonable resolution and distortion-free (e.g., warping, blurring, clouds, etc.).
        \item The UAV will be flying over land with minimal, and if so, minor, dynamic objects. That is, the environment is sufficiently static to make the system feasible.
        \item The UAV will be flying at a constant altitude. That is, scale estimation is not required.
        \item The ground is significantly planar. That is, any perspective distortion is minimal and can be ignored.
        \item The UAV and its cameras will always be level with the ground. That is, no pitch and roll will occur. 
        \item The system aim is to navigate the UAV back to base using reference images taken during flight with known telemetry (GPS and heading). The UAV will return back to base 
        \item The system output is an estimated GPS location and heading estimate, not a control system. This is sufficient for the pilots to manually control the UAV.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods and Approach}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Capture sequential images from UAV flights at different altitudes.
        \item The UAV should follow a predefined path with known GPS coordinates, heading, camera parameters, and altitude. Thereafter, the UAV should fly very close to the same path backward.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design and Development:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Research and test the accuracy and count of features in 5-10 different feature extraction methods. 
        \item Research and test the accuracy and count of matches in 5-10 different feature matching methods.
        \item Implement and evaluate different homographic estimation methods. 
        \item Implement and evaluate stereo vision methods.
        \item Implement and evaluate the system on a SBC.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Analysis:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use sequential image analysis to estimate new coordinates.
        \item Implement and evaluate pathfinding algorithms to calculate a path backward using past captured features.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Summary of Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The project aims to develop a robust and accurate image-based GPS location estimator for UAV navigation post-GPS signal loss. The system will be designed, developed, and tested for feature extraction, matching, homographic estimation, stereo vision, and computational requirements. The system will be implemented on a SBC for real-time operation.
    \item The project will have a significant impact on UAV navigation accuracy and reliability in GPS-denied environments, with potential applications in military and civilian contexts.
