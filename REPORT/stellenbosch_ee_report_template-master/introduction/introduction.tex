\section{Background}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable tools in various sectors, including military operations, surveillance, reconnaissance, and intelligence gathering. In South Africa, UAVs play a crucial role in border monitoring and supporting military missions by providing persistent aerial observation \cite{Weiss2024}. Their capability to operate in hazardous or inaccessible areas enhances operational effectiveness and safety.

Despite their widespread use, UAVs predominantly rely on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation and positioning. GNSS operates by utilizing a constellation of satellites that transmit precise time-stamped signals to Earth-based receivers. Each receiver calculates its position by measuring the time delay of signals from multiple satellites, requiring data from at least four satellites to determine its three-dimensional location. While GNSS provides essential Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information globally, its reliance on weak, line-of-sight satellite signals introduces significant vulnerabilities \cite{geotab2024gps}.

In recent years, the vulnerabilities of GNSS to jamming and spoofing have become increasingly pronounced. With the advent of more accessible jamming and spoofing technology, intentional GNSS interference is no longer a complex undertaking \cite{khalil2024gnss}. Instances of GNSS jamming and spoofing are particularly prevalent in conflict zones, where adversaries exploit GNSS weaknesses to disrupt or mislead UAV operations. The issue is far from hypothetical; over 1100 daily incidents of aircraft GNSS spoofing alone have been reported worldwide, underscoring the urgency of addressing these vulnerabilities \cite{khalil2024gnss}.

The increasing prevalence of GNSS disruptions has direct implications for national security, as UAVs may become disoriented or lost, jeopardizing missions and assets. Loss of GNSS signals can lead to an inability to locate the UAV, compromising control and potentially resulting in the UAV crashing or being captured. This situation emphasizes the critical need for alternative navigation solutions that can operate independently of external signals like GNSS. These systems must be robust, accurate, and adaptable to a wide range of environments, while also being cost-effective and minimizing detectability.

Various alternative navigation methods have been explored to mitigate reliance on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Quantum sensing navigation employs cold atom inertial sensors to achieve superior precision compared to traditional inertial measurement units (IMUs), but it is often prohibitively expensive and bulky \cite{wright2022cold}. Odometry-based solutions estimate UAV displacement through wheel rotation or accelerometer readings; however, they suffer from significant drift over extended distances, rendering their location estimations unusable for missions exceeding roughly 200 km, depending on their level of precision \cite{Zhuang2023}. Radio Frequency (RF) communication systems can triangulate UAV positions using ground beacons or cellular towers, yet their effectiveness is limited in remote areas and by the Earth's curvature, restricting their operational range to approximately 300 km \cite{brewer_line_2024}. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems map the ground by emitting laser pulses and measuring their return times to create detailed 3D environmental maps, but they are resource-intensive and emit detectable signals, which are undesirable for stealth operations prevalent in military contexts \cite{scoutaerial2024lidar}.

Image-based navigation emerges as a promising approach that does not succumb to the aforementioned issues. By leveraging onboard cameras, UAVs can reference images with associated telemetry data, either through an acquired database or by capturing images during flight prior to GNSS signal loss, to estimate their position and heading. This type of navigation relies on planar transformations, which relate two images of the same planar surface taken from different perspectives. These transformations enable the alignment of images from different viewpoints, facilitating the estimation of the UAV's orientation and position relative to reference telemetry data \cite{arafat2023vision}.

This method provides a financially accessible way to navigate in GNSS-denied environments without emitting detectable signals or suffering from drift. It benefits from advancements in computer vision and image processing techniques, which have significantly improved the robustness and accuracy of image processing tasks {CITE XXX}. SUMMARY OF LIT STUDIES - NOT ENOUGH SOLUTIONS. 
However, it remains unclear whether image-based systems can effectively operate in the context of UAV navigation. Specifically, it is uncertain if they can generalize to various terrains and operational conditions, such as varying light levels, while also achieving real-time operation and high accuracy. This study aims to create a working pipeline for this context and test it on real-world data, thereby addressing these uncertainties and evaluating the viability of image-based navigation as a redundancy measure to GNSS.

\section{Problem Statement}
The increasing frequency of GNSS disruptions due to jamming and spoofing poses a significant threat to UAV operations \cite{geotab2024gps}. Current alternatives to GNSS navigation, such as quantum sensing, odometry, RF communication, and LIDAR, are either too expensive, bulky, reduce stealth capabilities, or suffer from drift over time \cite{wright2022cold, Zhuang2023, brewer_line_2024, scoutaerial2024lidar}. To enhance the safety and effectiveness of national military missions, a comprehensive evaluation of a novel, image-based, redundancy navigation, system is required. Existing studies on image-based UAV navigation lack detailed system setups and fail to test performance across diverse environments and challenging conditions \cite{sim2002integrated, Zhang2024}.

\section{Aims and Objectives}
\subsection{Aim}

The primary aim of this project is to develop and evaluate an image-based navigation system for UAVs that can accurately estimate position and heading in GNSS-denied environments by leveraging images and telemetry data captured prior to GNSS-denial. This approach enables the UAV to navigate back to base post-GNSS denial by following its outbound path.

\subsection{Objectives}

To achieve the stated aim, the following objectives have been established:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Optimize the Localization Pipeline:} Identify and implement the most effective pipeline, including parameter selection and methodological approaches, to achieve the highest possible localization accuracy while maintaining real-time performance and generalizability. This includes the selection, integration and optimization of feature extraction, matching, and planar transformation estimation techniques.
    \item \textbf{Accurate Localization Estimation:} Estimate the latitude and longitude, using only prior telemetry data and image features, with a radial error below 10\% of the UAV's radial displacement from the reference image. This accuracy is sufficient for manual control of the UAV in GPS-denied environments, given that the system provides continuous correction.
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Operation:} Ensure the localization system operates in real-time, with a response time of less than 2 seconds following GNSS signal loss. This is sufficient as the relative motion of the UAV to the ground is sufficiently slow that a 2-second delay will not significantly affect the pilots ability to navigate.
    \item \textbf{Environmental Generalizability:} Validate that the system maintains its performance metrics across diverse environments without the need for environment-specific parameter tuning.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}
The scope of this project is defined to ensure feasibility within the allocated timeframe and resources. The following assumptions and limitations outline the project's boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Camera Alignment and Environment:} The UAV's downward-facing camera is assumed to remain perfectly aligned downward throughout all operations, with no pitch or roll. The ground is assumed to be predominantly planar at the altitude of image capture, simplifying the model by reducing the complexity of perspective distortion correction.
    \item \textbf{Constant Altitude:} The UAV maintains a constant altitude during operations, negating the requirement for scale estimation in localization calculations.
    \item \textbf{Image Quality and Visibility:} Captured images are assumed to have adequate resolution and visibility, without significant distortion or occlusion.
    \item \textbf{Static Environment:} The UAV operates over primarily static land surfaces with minimal dynamic objects, ensuring a stable environment for image-based localization.
    \item \textbf{Path Found:} The system assumed that complementary odometry-based systems have located the UAV's path when GNSS signals are lost, and the overlap of reference image information is greater than 60\%.
    \item \textbf{Methodology Focus:} The study aims to assess the system's viability using established methods and parameter sets, focusing on overall performance rather than exhaustive optimization of methods or parameters.
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning Constraints:} Machine learning methods requiring pre-training are excluded due to time and data constraints. 
    \item \textbf{No Integration:} The system uses image-based data to output estimated position and heading information for the UAV's, intended for navigation assistance; it does not integrate practically with navigation systems or control mechanisms.
    
\end{itemize}


\section{Data Provisioning}

An agreement was established with an external party to provide real-world flight data from their UAV operations for use in this study. However, the data was not provided within the project's timeframe. To proceed, Google Earth data was utilized as it offers free access to high-resolution aerial imagery with 3D terrain features and perspective changes, along with GPS coordinates, closely approximating real-world data. The use of estimated heading data, which is required to convert translation changes to latitude and longitude, is acknowledged to have an impact on accuracy, but no other solutions were available that would more closely meet the project goals within the available resources.
