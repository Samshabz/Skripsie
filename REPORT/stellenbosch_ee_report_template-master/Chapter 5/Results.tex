full pipeline testing 

Accuracy, time and translation under fully efficient conditions

test with low time constraints

test with low accuracy constraints

output runtime per image in both gps, and no gps stages



comment on applicability
comment on dynamic camera parameter inference

comment on generalizability




test with lower resolution 

test with crop

show path visuals: expected vs real path, scaled image with DOT 




Basically look at runtime per image in add phase, inference phase, and loss phase

GPS path estimate
