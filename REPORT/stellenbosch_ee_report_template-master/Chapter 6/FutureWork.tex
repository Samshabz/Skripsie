Z-estimate

On the google earth fly overs the pixel to metre conversion factor varied. 
Since the camera parameters remained constant, the ground was planar at the altitude, and this estimate is highly accurate, this change is primarily due to the change in altitude relative to the ground. 

In future one can infer the other. In other words, if one knows the camera parameters, and they have a datapoint from a previous flight, they can infer the altitude by simply scaling the altitude by the change in the pixel to metre conversion factor given the error-telemetry conversion factor estimate.
Conversely, if one has the altitude they can infer this factor in real-time without the need for error-telemetry conversion factor inference. Specifically, if the height of the UAV changes on the reverse flight, they can with certainty correct the factor, and ensure continued and correct GPS estimation.
